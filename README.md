Ever wanted to access your blockchain funds quickly but had to wait for hours while the blockchain downloads before doing so? 
The Waves Lite Client connects to public Waves nodes in order to retrieve up-to-date blockchain information.

We provide all the cryptography tools to create addresses, sign and verify transactions for the Waves blockchain. The Lite Client reads all the data from the public nodes, writes the transaction directly in the browser, and simply broadcasts it in a finished state.

# Security

During registration, the most important information is the wallet SEED. Save it somewhere safe, write it down on a piece of paper, or store it in different media.

With the SEED you can always import your account again or change the password.

This SEED will be AES-encrypted with a password of your choice and you can unlock it to access your account at the log-in screen.
Every transaction will be signed locally with JavaScript and transmitted to the node without revealing your wallet seed or private keys.

# Testnet and Mainnet

Please make sure that you are on MAINNET before importing any account, using any password or creating addresses with the intention of transferring real tokens. Accidentally using TESTNET would result in lost assets!
